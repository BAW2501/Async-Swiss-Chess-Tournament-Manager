first add players to tournament.xls file in the atteendess sheet
make sure they have an id ( number) first and last name ( full name not needed)

if you have an odd number of players add one called bye for example 

you can run the pairing program using 
python main.py

and it should update the pairings 

you can run the webserver using 
python display_server.py
to kill server ctrl + c

this will keep generating rounds infinitely 
but once you reach the round you want you can delete the rest of the pairings before running the server again
